# COMPSCI 683 (Artificial Intelligence) Homework 2

All code written by Justin Alvin and Mark Slater unless otherwise noted. Specifically, our backtracking-search algorithm implementation and helper methods in `utils.py` are based on implementations from Russell And Norvig's "Artificial Intelligence - A Modern Approach" at https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python.

## Problem 2

The code used in our solution for problem 2 is implemented in `sudoku.py` and can be executed by running `python sudoku.py`. Solutions for all steps in the problem will be printed out with log statements to indicate the sub-problem.

## Problem 2 extra credit

The code used in our solution for the extra credit in problem 2.6 is implemented in `difficulty_classifier.py` and can be executed by running `python difficulty_classifier.py`. This will retrain our classifier and print out predicted classes for the test data set. The actual test data classes are available for comparison in `data/tst_y.txt`.
